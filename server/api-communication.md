N. Chandrababu Naidu, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh from 1995 to 2004, whose visionary leadership helped reshape Hyderabad into \"Cyberabad,\" a thriving hub of information technology, innovation, and enterprise.N.Chandrababu Naidu’s rise to prominence in Indian politics came at a time when the country was opening up to globalization, thanks to the economic liberalization of 1991. Naidu recognized the untapped potential of Hyderabad, a city primarily known for its rich cultural heritage but lacking a modern economic infrastructure. As a leader, Naidu was pragmatic and forward-thinking, understanding that the future of India lies in technology and IT-driven services. With this vision, he embarked on a journey to transform Hyderabad into an international technology hub that could rival global cities like Silicon Valley. N. Chandrababu Naidu's strategy was multifaceted. First, he focused on infrastructure. Hyderabad’s roads, telecommunications, and transport systems were significantly improved, laying the groundwork for a business-friendly environment. Naidu also leveraged his strong ties with global business leaders, particularly in the technology sector, to bring in foreign direct investment (FDI). In a landmark move, he attracted Microsoft to open its first research and development center outside the United States in Hyderabad in 1998. This event was pivotal, signaling that Hyderabad was ready to be a part of the global IT revolution. Under N. Chandrababu Naidu's leadership, HITEC City (Hyderabad Information Technology and Engineering Consultancy City) was established as the epicenter of IT and technology companies. Located in the heart of what is now referred to as Cyberabad, HITEC City attracted giants like IBM, Oracle, Infosys, and Google, alongside a myriad of startups and local companies, which turned the region into a buzzing economic zone.N. Chandrababu Naidu's governance model was instrumental in Cyberabad’s rise. He introduced policies that cut through bureaucratic red tape, encouraging ease of doing business. His government offered tax incentives, developed specialized IT parks, and created policies favorable to both international investors and domestic entrepreneurs. Naidu was also a strong advocate of e-governance, using technology to streamline public administration and improve service delivery to citizens. Moreover, education and skill development were central to his plans. Naidu understood that a city’s success in the tech-driven economy would depend on its workforce. He pushed for partnerships between the government and academic institutions to build a strong talent pool in IT, engineering, and research.\nChoose New India Abroad for Overseas Indian Affairs\nChoose New India Abroad for Overseas Indian Affairs\nNew India Abroad\nNew India Abroad is the go-to source for reliable, in-depth coverage of Overseas Indian affairs.

From her first steps captured by paparazzi to her appearances on the arms of her famous mother in New York City, Suri Cruise has been a constant presence in the media. But behind the glamour and public interest lies a more private story — one of a mother’s deliberate effort to provide her daughter with a life that’s as grounded and “normal” as possible, despite the circumstances.\n2024 Trend Updates: What Really Works In SEO & Content Marketing\n2024 Trend Updates: What Really Works In SEO & Content Marketing\nSearch Engine Journal\nThe future of SEO is trending toward a more human-first and user-centric approach, powered by AI intelligence and collaboration.

Chandrababu Naidu, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh from 1995 to 2004, whose visionary leadership helped reshape Hyderabad into \"Cyberabad,\" a thriving hub of information technology, innovation, and enterprise.N.Chandrababu Naidu’s rise to prominence in Indian politics came at a time when the country was opening up to globalization, thanks to the economic liberalization of 1991. Naidu recognized the untapped potential of Hyderabad, a city primarily known for its rich cultural heritage but lacking a modern economic infrastructure. As a leader, Naidu was pragmatic and forward-thinking, understanding that the future of India lies in technology and IT-driven services. With this vision, he embarked on a journey to transform Hyderabad into an international technology hub that could rival global cities like Silicon Valley. N. Chandrababu Naidu's strategy was multifaceted. First, he focused on infrastructure. Hyderabad’s roads, telecommunications, and transport systems were significantly improved, laying the groundwork for a business-friendly environment. Naidu also leveraged his strong ties with global business leaders, particularly in the technology sector, to bring in foreign direct investment (FDI). In a landmark move, he attracted Microsoft to open its first research and development center outside the United States in Hyderabad in 1998. This event was pivotal, signaling that Hyderabad was ready to be a part of the global IT revolution. Under N. Chandrababu Naidu's leadership, HITEC City (Hyderabad Information Technology and Engineering Consultancy City) was established as the epicenter of IT and technology companies. Located in the heart of what is now referred to as Cyberabad, HITEC City attracted giants like IBM, Oracle, Infosys, and Google, alongside a myriad of startups and local companies, which turned the region into a buzzing economic zone.N. Chandrababu Naidu's governance model was instrumental in Cyberabad’s rise. He introduced policies that cut through bureaucratic red tape, encouraging ease of doing business. His government offered tax incentives, developed specialized IT parks, and created policies favorable to both international investors and domestic entrepreneurs. Naidu was also a strong advocate of e-governance, using technology to streamline public administration and improve service delivery to citizens. Moreover, education and skill development were central to his plans. Naidu understood that a city’s success in the tech-driven economy would depend on its workforce. He pushed for partnerships between the government and academic institutions to build a strong talent pool in IT, engineering, and research.\nChoose New India Abroad for Overseas Indian Affairs\nChoose New India Abroad for Overseas Indian Affairs\nNew India Abroad\nNew India Abroad is the go-to source for reliable, in-depth coverage of Overseas Indian affairs.

With Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise as her parents, her name was known before she could even walk. The spotlight has followed her since birth, and while many celebrity children fade from public attention as they grow older, Suri Cruise’s journey through childhood has remained a topic of public fascination. From her first steps captured by paparazzi to her appearances on the arms of her famous mother in New York City, Suri Cruise has been a constant presence in the media. But behind the glamour and public interest lies a more private story — one of a mother’s deliberate effort to provide her daughter with a life that’s as grounded and “normal” as possible, despite the circumstances.\nA Deep Dive Into African Culture: What’s Always in the News\nA Deep Dive Into African Culture: What’s Always in the News\nAFRICAN CULTURE TV\nHas Tracy Barlow Left Coronation Street for Good?\nHas Tracy Barlow Left Coronation Street for Good?\nFree News Report\nThe Birthday Cheat Sheet for 5-22-2025.pdf\nThe Birthday Cheat Sheet for 5-22-2025.pdf\nAbdul-Hakim Shabazz\nIndia on World News: The Rise of a Global Power | New India Abroad\nIndia on World News: The Rise of a Global Power | New India Abroad\nNew India Abroad\nCatching Up with Paul Qualley: His Journey Beyond Fame\nCatching Up with Paul Qualley: His Journey Beyond Fame\nFree News Report\nThe Trump Presidency’s World-Historical Heist\nThe Trump Presidency’s World-Historical Heist\nLUMINATIVE MEDIA/PROJECT COUNSEL MEDIA GROUP\n26-May-2025 Current Affairs | UPSC Daily Dose\n26-May-2025 Current Affairs | UPSC Daily Dose\nZenstudy\nLegalisation of prostitutuon as freedom of trade.pdf\nLegalisation of prostitutuon as freedom of trade.pdf\nhimanshuadhinayak\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC): Route, Impact, & Geopolitical Challe...\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC): Route, Impact, & Geopolitical Challe...\nAaryan Kansari\nChandrababu Naidu's Leadership in Disaster Management and Relief Efforts\nChandrababu Naidu's Leadership in Disaster Management and Relief Efforts\nnarsireddynannuri1\nUnveiling_Transformative_Megatrends_in_Western_Europe.pdf\nUnveiling_Transformative_Megatrends_in_Western_Europe.pdf\nnicholesim1\nCyberabad Unveiled: How Chandrababu Naidu Transformed Hyderabad into a Global...\nCyberabad Unveiled: How Chandrababu Naidu Transformed Hyderabad into a Global...\nnarsireddynannuri1\nChoose New India Abroad for Overseas Indian Affairs\nChoose New India Abroad for Overseas Indian Affairs\nNew India Abroad\nDaniel Dubois Closing In on Rematch with Usyk at Wembley – July 12 Targeted\nDaniel Dubois Closing In on Rematch with Usyk at Wembley – July 12 Targeted\nFree News Report\nJohnny Somali and the Ethics of Shock Content Online\nJohnny Somali and the Ethics of Shock Content Online\nFree News Report\nTop 25 Stories 2025 by S Vijay Kumar.pdf\nTop 25 Stories 2025 by S Vijay Kumar.pdf\nSanskarTiwari20\n„The best thing in the world is to be Hungarian!”\n„The best thing in the world is to be Hungarian!”\nGábor Polyák\nThree Documents of the Maoist Communist Group\nThree Documents of the Maoist Communist Group\nMLMartista\nUnveiling_Transformative_Megatrends_in_Latin_America.pdf\nUnveiling_Transformative_Megatrends_in_Latin_America.pdf\nnicholesim1\nSuri Cruise Then and Now: Growing Up in the Shadow of Celebrity\nSuri Cruise Then and Now: Growing Up in the Shadow of Celebrity\nFree News Report\nFeatured\n(20)\n2024 Trend Updates: What Really Works In SEO & Content Marketing\n2024 Trend Updates: What Really Works In SEO & Content Marketing\nSearch Engine Journal\nThe future of SEO is trending toward a more human-first and user-centric approach, powered by AI intelligence and collaboration.

Dozens of U.S. states are currently suing Meta for contributing to the youth mental health crisis by inserting addictive features into their products, while the U.S. Surgeon General is touring the nation to bring awareness to the growing epidemic of loneliness and isolation. The country has endured periods of low national morale, such as in the 1970s when high inflation and the energy crisis worsened public sentiment following the Vietnam War. The current mood, however, feels different. Gallup recently reported that national mental health is at an all-time low, with few bright spots to lift spirits. To better understand how Americans are feeling and their attitudes towards mental health in general, ThinkNow conducted a nationally representative quantitative survey of 1,500 respondents and found some interesting differences among ethnic, age and gender groups. Technology For example, 52% agree that technology and social media have a negative impact on mental health, but when broken out by race, 61% of Whites felt technology had a negative effect, and only 48% of Hispanics thought it did. While technology has helped us keep in touch with friends and family in faraway places, it appears to have degraded our ability to connect in person. Staying connected online is a double-edged sword since the same news feed that brings us pictures of the grandkids and fluffy kittens also feeds us news about the wars in Israel and Ukraine, the dysfunction in Washington, the latest mass shooting and the climate crisis. Hispanics may have a built-in defense against the isolation technology breeds, owing to their large, multigenerational households, strong social support systems, and tendency to use social media to stay connected with relatives abroad. Age and Gender When asked how individuals rate their mental health, men rate it higher than women by 11 percentage points, and Baby Boomers rank it highest at 83%, saying it’s good or excellent vs. 57% of Gen Z saying the same. Gen Z spends the most amount of time on social media, so the notion that social media negatively affects mental health appears to be correlated. Unfortunately, Gen Z is also the generation that’s least comfortable discussing mental health concerns with healthcare professionals. Only 40% of them state they’re comfortable discussing their issues with a professional compared to 60% of Millennials and 65% of Boomers. Race Affects Attitudes As seen in previous research conducted by ThinkNow, Asian Americans lag other groups when it comes to awareness of mental health issues. Twenty-four percent of Asian Americans believe that having a mental health issue is a sign of weakness compared to the 16% average for all groups. Asians are also considerably less likely to be aware of mental health services in their communities (42% vs. 55%) and most likely to seek out information on social media (51% vs. 35%).\nAI Trends in Creative Operations 2024 by Artwork Flow.pdf\nAI Trends in Creative Operations 2024 by Artwork Flow.pdf\nmarketingartwork\nCreative operations teams expect increased AI use in 2024. Currently, over half of tasks are not AI-enabled, but this is expected to decrease in the coming year. ChatGPT is the most popular AI tool currently. Business leaders are more actively exploring AI benefits than individual contributors. Most respondents do not believe AI will impact workforce size in 2024. However, some inhibitions still exist around AI accuracy and lack of understanding. Creatives primarily want to use AI to save time on mundane tasks and boost productivity.\nSkeleton Culture Code\nSkeleton Culture Code\nSkeleton Technologies\nOrganizational culture includes values, norms, systems, symbols, language, assumptions, beliefs, and habits that influence employee behaviors and how people interpret those behaviors. It is important because culture can help or hinder a company's success.

Dozens of U.S. states are currently suing Meta for contributing to the youth mental health crisis by inserting addictive features into their products, while the U.S. Surgeon General is touring the nation to bring awareness to the growing epidemic of loneliness and isolation. The country has endured periods of low national morale, such as in the 1970s when high inflation and the energy crisis worsened public sentiment following the Vietnam War. The current mood, however, feels different. Gallup recently reported that national mental health is at an all-time low, with few bright spots to lift spirits. To better understand how Americans are feeling and their attitudes towards mental health in general, ThinkNow conducted a nationally representative quantitative survey of 1,500 respondents and found some interesting differences among ethnic, age and gender groups. Technology For example, 52% agree that technology and social media have a negative impact on mental health, but when broken out by race, 61% of Whites felt technology had a negative effect, and only 48% of Hispanics thought it did. While technology has helped us keep in touch with friends and family in faraway places, it appears to have degraded our ability to connect in person. Staying connected online is a double-edged sword since the same news feed that brings us pictures of the grandkids and fluffy kittens also feeds us news about the wars in Israel and Ukraine, the dysfunction in Washington, the latest mass shooting and the climate crisis. Hispanics may have a built-in defense against the isolation technology breeds, owing to their large, multigenerational households, strong social support systems, and tendency to use social media to stay connected with relatives abroad. Age and Gender When asked how individuals rate their mental health, men rate it higher than women by 11 percentage points, and Baby Boomers rank it highest at 83%, saying it’s good or excellent vs. 57% of Gen Z saying the same. Gen Z spends the most amount of time on social media, so the notion that social media negatively affects mental health appears to be correlated. Unfortunately, Gen Z is also the generation that’s least comfortable discussing mental health concerns with healthcare professionals. Only 40% of them state they’re comfortable discussing their issues with a professional compared to 60% of Millennials and 65% of Boomers. Race Affects Attitudes As seen in previous research conducted by ThinkNow, Asian Americans lag other groups when it comes to awareness of mental health issues. Twenty-four percent of Asian Americans believe that having a mental health issue is a sign of weakness compared to the 16% average for all groups. Asians are also considerably less likely to be aware of mental health services in their communities (42% vs. 55%) and most likely to seek out information on social media (51% vs. 35%).\nQUIZ-O-FORCE 3.0 FINAL SET BY SOURAV .pptx\nQUIZ-O-FORCE 3.0 FINAL SET BY SOURAV .pptx\nSourav Kr Podder\nQUIZ-O-FORCE 3.0 FINAL SET BY SOURAV\nYSPH VMOC Special Report - Measles Outbreak Southwest US 5-25-2025.pptx\nYSPH VMOC Special Report - Measles Outbreak Southwest US 5-25-2025.pptx\nYale School of Public Health - The Virtual Medical Operations Center (VMOC)\nCURRENT CASE COUNT: 880 • Texas: 729 (+5) (56% of cases are in Gaines County) • New Mexico: 78 (+4) (83% of cases are from Lea County) • Oklahoma: 17 • Kansas: 56 (38.89% of the cases are from Gray County) HOSPITALIZATIONS: 103 • Texas: 94 - This accounts for 13% of all cases in the State. • New Mexico: 7 – This accounts for 9.47% of all cases in New Mexico. • Kansas: 2 - This accounts for 3.7% of all cases in Kansas.

Drawing from the Qur'an, authentic hadith collections, and classical tafsir, the article affirms the event as a literal miracle performed by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in response to the Quraysh’s demand for a sign. It also investigates external historical accounts, particularly the legend of Cheraman Perumal, a South Indian king who allegedly witnessed the miracle and embraced Islam. The article critically examines the authenticity and impact of such regional traditions, while also discussing the lack of parallel astronomical records and how scholars have interpreted this event across centuries. Concluding with the theological significance of the miracle, the article offers a well-rounded view of one of Islam’s most discussed supernatural events.\nPhilosophical Basis of Curriculum Designing\nPhilosophical Basis of Curriculum Designing\nAnkit Choudhary\nThe philosophical basis of curriculum refers to the foundational beliefs and values that shape the goals, content, structure, and methods of education. Major educational philosophies—idealism, realism, pragmatism, and existentialism—guide how knowledge is selected, organized, and delivered to learners. In the digital age, understanding these philosophies helps educators and content creators design curriculum materials that are purposeful, learner-centred, and adaptable for online environments. By aligning educational content with philosophical principles and presenting it through interactive and multimedia formats.\nKNN,Weighted KNN,Nearest Centroid Classifier,Locally Weighted Regression\nKNN,Weighted KNN,Nearest Centroid Classifier,Locally Weighted Regression\nGlobal Academy of Technology\nKNN Weighted KNN Nearest Centroid Classifier Locally Weighted Regression\nProtest - Student Revision Booklet For VCE English\nProtest - Student Revision Booklet For VCE English\njpinnuck\nThe 'Protest Student Revision Booklet' is a comprehensive resource to scaffold students to prepare for writing about this idea framework on a SAC or for the exam.

The article critically examines the authenticity and impact of such regional traditions, while also discussing the lack of parallel astronomical records and how scholars have interpreted this event across centuries. Concluding with the theological significance of the miracle, the article offers a well-rounded view of one of Islam’s most discussed supernatural events.\nPhilosophical Basis of Curriculum Designing\nPhilosophical Basis of Curriculum Designing\nAnkit Choudhary\nThe philosophical basis of curriculum refers to the foundational beliefs and values that shape the goals, content, structure, and methods of education.

There are many possible user intents beyond just transactional, navigational and informational. Identifying intent shifts is important during core updates. Sites may need to optimize for new intents through different content types and sections. 3.

Curriculum instructive and inclusive document is also affected. The teachers’ as key stakeholder of education and curriculum development are mostly ignored of curriculum development process and mostly play only role as curriculum implementer. No any academic and systematic research available on Teachers’ role in development of curriculum on elementary level in Afghanistan My experiences in field of education always observing different no standardize curriculum To contribute and explore new knowledge on teachers’ role in C.D process PhD candidate, of relevant DEPT. I have tried to conduct a research study to find out new information on teachers’ role, the obstacles forward them, their views, suggestion and ….. 5-6\n7.\nChapter Two/Literature Review\n( key Points) Before to conduct the field research, I have read and review too much relevant literature, globally, regionally and on national level. My findings from literatures show that: Constructivist ground Theory is a practical guide through qualitative analysis” (Schram, 2006). Symbolic interactionism is recognized as an interpretive methodology supported by pragmatism as the basis of the theoretical perspective (Blumer 1969) and (Mead 1932) The conceptual framework organizes the key concepts in the study in order to define the focus and direction for the study. The key concepts are derived from reviewing the related topics and phrases existing in literature, and from the findings of the literature theories (Grant & Osanloo, 2014). The paradigm is an interpretive or constructionist paradigm seeks to understand human behavior and social contexts by understanding the meanings actors give to their actions, goals, roles, identities, and all aspects of the world they experience. The assumption is that these meanings will be varied and will develop differently in different contexts (Cresswell, 2018). Therefore, the psychological and social worlds being investigated are not assumed to be straightforwardly predictable and governed by general laws of cause and effect (Howitt, 2016). 5-7\n8.\nChapter Two/Literature Review\n( key Points) On global level particularly, in developed and in fast developing countries, teachers, are mostly involved in all (planning, contents and method development, implementation and evaluation) stages of curriculum. On international level specifically USA, China, Canada, Australia and Japan having standardized education system and inclusive curriculum development process. China has launched a unique Curriculum Reform which involves 474,000 schools, 10 million teachers, and 200 million students (China Education and Research Network, 2011). In USA, Canada, Australia and Japan have given outstanding (more than 80%) role to teachers’ in curriculum development process. in the regional countries of Afghanistan (Turkey, Pakistan and Azerbaijan), 55% of surveyed teachers in Turkey confirmed that they did not actively involved in curriculum development process. around 92 % of Teachers in Pakistan reported that they are ignored in curriculum reforming and development process, they told “they are only the implementers of Curriculum, our views are not considering as a key force of education” (Ali, S. H 2009). During (1919-1922) King Amanullah Khan founded the ministry of education and the ministry has created a joint team of Indian, Turkish and Afghan education professionals and re- designed and developed a comprehensive curriculum for schools. The curriculum was emphasizing on: In the elementary school pupils studied Islamic studies, local languages (Dari and Pashtu), mathematics, geography, and calligraphy. 06/02/25 5-8\n9.\nChapter Three/ The\nResearch Design And Methodology( Key points) • For conducting of this research study, mixed research design approach (qualitative and quantitative) was selected but mainly the study is qualitative.
