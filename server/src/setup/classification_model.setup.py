"""
This module is used to Initialize and Set Up the Classification Model for the Application.

The Classification Model is Used by the Data Analyzer Agent to Classify the Data into Different Themes (Buckets) based on the User Query and the Data Collected from the Sprinklr API.

# Functionality:
- This Module Provides the Functinality to Initialize and Set Up the Classification Model.
- Functinns to Take in the List of Data and the Refined User Prompt and Classify  and Return the Data into Different Themes (Buckets) based on the User Query.
- The Classification Model can be a Pre-trained Model or a Custom Model that is Trained on the Data Collected from the Sprinklr API.
- The Classification Model can be a Zero-Shot Classification Model, Clustering Model, or any other Model that can be used to classify the data into different themes.
- You can use the Hugging Face Transformers Library to Load and Use the Pre-trained Models for Zero-Shot Classification or any other Classification Task like the "facebook/bart-large-mnli".
